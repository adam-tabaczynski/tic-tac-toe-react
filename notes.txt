// State has been moved from Square to Board for further
// advancement of the game - it is needed to determine the winner.
// The Squares are still clickable, yet they rerender accordingly
// to changes of Board's state.

  // the .slice() allows creating a copy of squares array
  // instead of modifying OG array. This allows immutability
  // of objects, which in exchange gives some benefits:
  // 1) Avoiding direct data change allows to simplify complex
  // functionalities like game history,
  // 2) Detecting changes in objects is much easier;
  // 3) Not changing objects allow creating pure components in
  // React and easify determining when component requires 
  // re-rendering.
